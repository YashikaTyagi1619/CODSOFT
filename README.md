These are some c++ projects which I was assigned during my codsoft internship. There are total of three tasks which are as follows:



Task 1 is a number guessing game :A program that generates a random number and asks the
user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too
high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

Task 2 is a Simple Calculator :A calculator program that performs basic arithmetic
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an
operation to perform.

Task 3 is a word count program : Develop a program that counts the number of words in a given
text file. Prompt the user to enter the file name and display the
total word count.
